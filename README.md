The program uses 3 different seekbars and based of these seekbar values (red, green, blue from 0-255) a color will be produced. This color actively changes the background color of the application and update a hex ref value.
Once the save color button is pressed, the color will be added to the listview that using a array list.
The text of the TextViews will change from black to white if the color is too dark or from white to black if the color is too light.
If you press on a color from the listview, the color will update the seekbar value information and the hex value.
From that color that is pressed you can create a new color without editing that color from the listview.
